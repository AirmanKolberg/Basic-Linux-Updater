# Basic Update Script Installer

This is a simple script I wrote for my fianc√©e, who I've recently got into her first Linux distro, Ubuntu LTS.  I know, very soon she'll be on BlackArch, I'm so proud.

However, simple Terminal-based functions such as:

```shell
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```
are still very new at this point.  Because of this, I've written this simple script that creates a shell file called "update" (no quotes) that is executable from any directory within the Terminal.  This completely negates the need for her to memorise such a long and tedious command, when instead, she can update her computer with a simple "update" followed by typing in the password when prompted.  The setup instructions are simple as well, of course, and the steps are as follows:

1. Ensure your Linux computer has Python on it.  It probably already does if you're here.
2. Change directory (```cd```) over to installer.py's location
3. Run the installer with ```python3 installer.py```

That's it.  The installer will ask if you wish to deleted the installer.py file when done, which I recommend you do.  Why waste the extra 2KB, right?  Storage ain't free, ya' know.
